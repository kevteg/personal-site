I'm **Kevin**. I'm a software developer and a CS engineering student, 
I love building software and learning cool new stuff in the way. My favorite programming languages and technologies are Python 🐍, C, C++, Go 🐹, Docker 🐳, Linux 🐧 and Javascript too (usually).

This blog is a playground for my ideas/thoughts/projects, I think writing things down is a great way to learn 🚀. I am a big fan of science 🔭, love learning foreign languajes and I think re-inventing the wheel is great __sometimes__ 🔧.

 This page is completly static and makes use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


If you want to, feel free to say __"hi"__ 👋, you can find all my contact info at the [home page.](https://keeev.in/)
